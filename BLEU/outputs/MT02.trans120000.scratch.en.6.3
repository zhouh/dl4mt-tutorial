according to the survey office of china , it was at the beginning of last friday that beijing attacked beijing on 1 july that beijing , which is in 1988 , will be able to make use of beijing as a UNK .
i do not believe that it would be impossible for me to say that there will be no UNK in the opening up to the end of this year .
what we can do is to control the UNK factors and prevent the environment of the environment . '
he said , however , as usual , in times of trends , UNK , and UNK , hong kong will not be able to do so in the short run .
in 2002 - 88 , the chinese government took over to $ UNK million , from $ UNK million in 1988 - 88 , with a view to preventing the emergence of UNK and reducing the number of people .
it is only in this year that we will spend about $ 1 billion , about about $ 200 million .
one of the experts in the chinese institute of science and technology said : ' it is likely that the increase in funds will bring about a substantial improvement in the situation , but it is perhaps necessary for us to see the results of decades before we can see the results of management . '
after the survey conducted by the chinese environment experts on completion of surveys this year , some of china 's major territories is now in the forefront of the world , and this is largely a result of human economic activities , such as UNK .
the survey report said that in the first six months of last year , 18 per cent were in beijing and 60 per cent were in inner mongolia .
on the day before the end of this month , representatives of representatives from shanghai , beijing , and inner mongolia urged the government to build up the green paper of the green paper , so as to stop the attack .

it is found that there are quite a number of certificates of certificates by university students .
last year , a large number of enterprises were set up to set up branches in the asia-pacific region and led a group of university students .

in recent years , in a number of UNK institutions in guangdong , there is no provision for certificates of academic qualifications , but , for example , they are guilty of students who are able to produce certificates of certificates for students to produce a certificate of certificates to students when they graduated in students .

as a result of seoul , we can see that the number of people involved in the number of millions of people who have entered into the rok has been in force since the beginning of this year .
last year , there were UNK million people who were in the rok and who were in the rok .
25 per cent of the 25 were in the centre of the capital of hong kong .

they also said that iraq had one of the UNK of baghdad in baghdad in 1992 .
it is likely for us to warn us that it is likely that the patriotic alliance might be able to give evidence to some of the reports on the publication of the UNK system .
newspaper in the gulf : sir , it is a failure for us to be silent in the middle east .
the white paper on the subject of the middle east of the middle east , which is a matter of the middle east , said on monday that it is in the middle east of the middle east .
